# Public Datasets

These are some of the public data sets which I have used for my personal projects in Python/Unix/SQL and for building data dashboards in Tableau.

These data sets are sourced from - Kaggle, data.gov, Google trends etc. Some of the data sets might have been modified (without corrupting the actual data) to fit the scope of the project.

"Datasets" repository serves as a common go-to place for sourcing datasets for all data related activities.
